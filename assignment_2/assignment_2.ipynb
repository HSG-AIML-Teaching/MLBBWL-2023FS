    "The **goal** of this assignment is to perform clustering on **two separate datasets**: `blobs` contains a number of Gaussian clusters, wheres `moon` contains two crescent-shaped clusters that are intertwined. Both datasets are two-dimensional and contain different numbers of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your **objectives** are the following:\n",
    "* Visualize both datasets.\n",
    "* Implement at least one clustering method to identify clusters in the `blobs` dataset; how many different clusters are there in the dataset?\n",
    "* Implement at least one clustering method that separates the vast majority of samples from the two crescent-shaped clusters in the `moons` dataset.\n",
    "* For each dataset, visualize the resulting clusters by plotting samples belonging to different clusters in different clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be **graded** based on:\n",
    "* whether these objectives have been achieved;\n",
    "* whether the solution follows best practices;\n",
    "* how well the approach is documented (e.g., using text cells, plots, etc.);\n",
    "* how clean the code is.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no restrictions on the resources that you can use -- collaborating on assignments is allowed -- but students are not allowed to submit identical code.\n",
