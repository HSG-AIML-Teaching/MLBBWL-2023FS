    "The **goal** of this assignment is to implement a $k$-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier that performs classification on the accompanied dataset. The dataset is 5-dimensional and consists of numerical features, only. Each datapoint belongs to either of three classes. Train a kNN classifier in such a way as to maximize its performance and to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general **objectives** are:\n",
    "* to implement the ML pipeline using *scikit-learn* as discussed in the lecture and the lab course, following best practices;\n",
    "* to properly perform hyperparameter tuning from which clearly follows which value of $k$ has been chosen and why;\n",
    "* to compare the performance of the best trained model on the training, validation and test datasets, preventing both overfitting and underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will be **graded** based on:\n",
    "* whether these objectives have been achieved;\n",
    "* whether the solution follows best practices;\n",
    "* how well the approach is documented (e.g., using text cells, plots, etc.);\n",
    "* how clean the code is;\n",
    "* the performance of the trained model.\n",

    "There are no restrictions on the resources that you can use -- collaborating on assignments is allowed -- but students are not allowed to submit identical code.\n",
